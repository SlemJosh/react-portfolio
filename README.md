# React Portfolio

## Description

This project was about designing and coding a developers portfolio using the react language. It allows us to change parts of it without altering all of it, and it made the portfolio very professional looking.  Some of the challenges that came along with it were just trying to understand how each page is represented on a react scenario.  The nice thing is that because its using react we can edit it on the fly and see our changes immediately as opposed to having to stop the server and relaunch for every change.  It's very big contrast from the earlier portfolio that was done just using html, js, and css.
